![Dashboard 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cd9c0f4-efc4-4dfd-8b3f-bad214b7c6bd)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing and visualising travel data from British Airways using Tableau. The goal is to extract insights and present them in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

## Data Sources

The project uses two primary datasets:
1. **Countries.csv**: Contains information about various countries.
2. **ba_reviews.csv**: Contains customer reviews and ratings for British Airways.

## Project Files

- **Countries.csv**: This file contains information about different countries including country codes, names, and other relevant details.
- **ba_reviews.csv**: This file contains reviews and ratings from customers who have travelled with British Airways.
- **British Airways Reviews.twbx**: The Tableau workbook file containing the visualizations and dashboards created for this project.

## Steps for Analysis and Visualization

### 1. Data Preparation
- Import the datasets `Countries.csv` and `ba_reviews.csv` into Tableau.
- Clean the data to ensure there are no missing or incorrect entries.
- Join the datasets on relevant keys to combine country information with the review data. In this case join place to countries using a 1:1 join 

### 2. Data Analysis
- Analyse the customer reviews to extract key metrics such as average rating, distribution of ratings, and common feedback themes.
- Segment the data based on various dimensions such as travel class, destination, and review date.

### 3. Visualisation
- Create various visualizations to represent the analyzed data:
  - **Bar Charts**: To show the distribution of ratings.
  - **Line Charts**: To show trends over time.
  - **Maps**: To visualize review data geographically.
- Develop interactive dashboards to allow users to filter and explore the data based on different criteria.

### 4. Dashboard Design
- Design intuitive and user-friendly dashboards that present insights in an easily understandable manner.
- Include interactive elements such as filters, tooltips, and drill-down capabilities.

## How to Use the Tableau Workbook

1. Open the `British Airways Reviews.twbx` file in Tableau.
2. Explore the different dashboards to gain insights into the travel data.
3. Use the interactive features to filter the data and drill down into specific aspects of the reviews.

## Project Outcomes

The project provides a comprehensive analysis of British Airways' customer reviews, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. The interactive visualisations enable stakeholders to explore the data in depth and make informed decisions based on the insights derived.

## Requirements

- Tableau Desktop (to open and explore the Tableau workbook)
- Basic understanding of Tableau for navigation and interaction with the dashboards
